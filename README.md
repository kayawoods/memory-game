# Emoji Memory

![LOGO](/LOGO/emoji%20memory%20logo.png)

Emoji Memory tests your memory and concentration. As soon as the page loads, a 90-second timer starts counting down. Your goal is to match all 24 face-down cards with their pairs. Only two cards can be flipped at a time until a match is made. Win or lose, you can always play again. Click the button to reshuffle the cards and restart the timer.

## Getting Started 

### [Play the game](https://kayawoods.github.io/memory-game/)

#### How to Play: 
* Click a card to flip it over 
* Click a second card to flip it over 
* If they match, they stay face up
* If they don't, they flip back over and your next turn begins.
* Keep going until all pairs are matched or time runs out - whichever comes first. 
* Click "Play Again Friend" to shuffle the cards and restart the time
